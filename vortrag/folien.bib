        abstract = {The Internet has matured to a critical infrastructure in many countries. The national importance of routing motivates
        us to study the AS-level subgraph that is relevant for a country. In this paper, we report on a methodology and tool chain for
        identifying and classifying a 'national Internet', and evaluate detailed results for the example of Germany. Our contribution (a)
        identifies the ASes that are important for the country, (b) classifies these ASes into functional sectors, (c) constructs the AS
        routing graph of a country as well as subgraphs of specific sectors, and (d) analyzes structural dependencies between key players.
        Our methods indicate the importance of examining individual IP-blocks held by individual organizations, as this reveals 25\% more
        stakeholders compared to only looking at prefixes. We quantify the centrality of ASes with respect to specific sectors and the
        robustness of communication communities. Our results show that members of sectoral groups tend to avoid direct peering, but
        inter-connect via a small set of common ISPs. Even though applied for Germany here, all methods are designed general enough to
        work for most countries, as well.},

@article{0903.3218v1,
        abstract = {The treatment of Internet traffic is increasingly affected by national policies that require the ISPs in a country to
        adopt common protocols or practices. Examples include government enforced censorship, wiretapping, and protocol deployment
        mandates for IPv6 and DNSSEC. If an entire nation's worth of ISPs apply common policies to Internet traffic, the global
        implications could be significant. For instance, how many countries rely on China or Great Britain (known traffic censors) to
        transit their traffic? These kinds of questions are surprisingly difficult to answer, as they require combining information
        collected at the prefix, Autonomous System, and country level, and grappling with incomplete knowledge about the AS-level topology
        and routing policies. In this paper we develop the first framework for country-level routing analysis, which allows us to answer
        questions about the influence of each country on the flow of international traffic. Our results show that some countries known for
        their national policies, such as Iran and China, have relatively little effect on interdomain routing, while three countries (the
        United States, Great Britain, and Germany) are central to international reachability, and their policies thus have huge potential
        impact.},
